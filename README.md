# arch-post-install

### Arch Post Minimal Install Script (WIP)

Installs Plasma/KDE desktop and additional software.

### Usage
After minimal install, reboot and log in to your account:

git clone https://github.com/wim66/arch-post-install

cd arch-post-install

sh arch-post-install.sh (no sudo!)

### What the script does

The system will be updated first

Most packages will be installed by default (check the script and remove what you don't want)

In the dialog boxes for pacman and yay you can pick additional software you would like to install

AUR packages installed with yay can take time to build

<ins>Zsh will be the default shell with a pre-configured setup with oh-my-zsh and oh-my-posh prompt</ins>

Notes

This script is based on my personal preferences

Pulseaudio was chosen for the minimal Arch install

Customization

You can edit the script to change it to the way you want it.
